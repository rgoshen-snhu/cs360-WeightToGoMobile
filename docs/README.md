# Documentation

This directory holds all documentation for the WeighToGo repository — both the
preserved Android artifact and the CS 499 web rebuild. Use this page as the
entry point for anything under `docs/`.

## Authority

When two documents disagree, use this order of precedence:

1. **`specs/WeighToGo_Web_SRS_v1.md`** — authoritative system spec for the web
   rebuild. Wins over every other web-related doc.
2. **`plans/milestone-two-plan.md`** — the active CS 499 Milestone Two
   implementation brief. References sections of the SRS that are in scope for
   M2.
3. **`adr/` and `ddr/`** — point-in-time decisions; superseded entries are
   marked in their own status field, not deleted.
4. **`architecture/`** — Android-era technical docs. Historical reference only
   for the web rebuild.
