## 1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

The artifact is **Weigh to Go!**, a weight-tracking application I originally
built as a native Android app for **CS 360 (Mobile Architecture and
Programming)** in 2025. The Android version uses Java, the Android SDK,
SQLite for local persistence, and Material Components for the UI. Its
feature set covers user registration and login, daily weight logging with
unit selection, weight history, goal setting and progress tracking, push and
SMS notifications for goal achievements, and basic accessibility settings.

For the CS 499 capstone I have rebuilt Weigh to Go! as a **full-stack web
application** while preserving the original Android codebase in the same
repository as a historical artifact. The web rebuild uses **React 19 with
TypeScript** and Material UI v9 on the frontend, **FastAPI on Python 3.12**
with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and Pydantic v2 on the backend, and **PostgreSQL** for
persistence. Both stacks live in a polyglot monorepo: `android/` holds the
preserved Java code and `web/` holds the new Python and TypeScript code.

This narrative covers **Milestone Two (Software Design and Engineering)**,
which delivered the architectural foundation, the authentication system,
weight-entry CRUD, and the dashboard summary — the vertical slice that
proves the architecture works end-to-end. Milestone Two is tagged `v0.1.0`.

## 2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio

### Why this artifact

I selected Weigh to Go! because the original Android version, while
functionally complete for CS 360, surfaced concrete architectural debt under
a structured engineering code review I performed at the start of the
capstone. The findings — over-large activity classes with single-responsibility
violations, model-view-controller drift, database writes executed on the UI
thread, an `ExecutorService` lifecycle defect, unmasked personally identifiable
information in logs, username enumeration through differentiated authentication
error messages, a hardcoded navigation chain, and accessibility gaps — were
architectural rather than incidental. Patching them in place would have left
the underlying design problems unchanged. Rebuilding as a full-stack web
application lets me address every finding through deliberate design rather
than incremental repair, while also demonstrating modern web engineering
practices that are directly relevant to my career goals.

### Components that showcase software-engineering skills

The Milestone Two work showcases the following:

- **Three-pattern backend architecture** (`web/backend/src/weighttogo/`) combining
  Screaming Architecture (folder structure named after bounded contexts —
  `auth/`, `weight_tracking/`, `goals/`, `users/`), Clean Architecture (the
  dependency rule, enforced in CI by `import-linter` — domain code with any
  framework import breaks the build), and Hexagonal Architecture (ports
  defined in the domain, adapters in `infrastructure/`). The decision is
  documented in [ADR-0012](../adr/0012-three-pattern-backend-architecture.md).

- **Security baseline applied from the first commit.** Email as the primary
  user identifier ([ADR-0009](../adr/0009-email-as-primary-user-identifier.md)),
  generic authentication error messages to prevent username enumeration
  ([ADR-0010](../adr/0010-generic-authentication-error-policy.md)), PII
  masking in every log statement ([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-pii-masking-strategy-in-logs.md)),
  refresh-token rotation with family-based revocation to detect token replay
  ([ADR-0013](../adr/0013-refresh-token-rotation-family-revocation.md)),
  bcrypt password hashing at cost 12, account lockout, and rate-limited auth
  endpoints — every finding from the Android code review is addressed by a
  specific countermeasure with a specific test.

- **Test-driven development discipline throughout.** The Milestone Two diff
  is 544 files / +28,479 / −598 lines across 173 commits. It carries **277
  backend tests** (pytest) and **241 frontend test cases** (vitest) plus
  five end-to-end Playwright specs, with coverage at or above the SRS §11
  threshold. Every feature was written test-first; the commit history shows
  the red-green-refactor cadence.

- **RFC 7807 problem-details error responses** on every API path, with
  field-level validation detail for 422 responses. Both the backend
  emission and the frontend parsing are tested.

- **Cursor-based pagination** with an opaque compound cursor
  ([ADR-0015](../adr/0015-opaque-compound-cursor-pagination.md)) — surfaced
  during PR #30 review when the first-cut cursor leaked schema and skipped
  rows at page boundaries. Authoring an ADR mid-PR captured both the bug
  and the corrected design in one place.

- **Documentation discipline.** A versioned Software Requirements
  Specification ([`/docs/specs/WeighToGo_Web_SRS_v1.md`](../specs/WeighToGo_Web_SRS_v1.md))
  is the authoritative source for architecture, requirements, API, and
  quality gates. Nine new Architecture Decision Records (ADR-0007 through
  ADR-0015) capture every M2 decision with alternatives considered. A
  reverse-chronological `SUMMARY.md` records the rationale and bug-fix
  context for every commit.

### How the artifact was improved

The web rebuild resolves every finding from the Android code review through
deliberate design. The architectural changes — three-pattern backend, ports
and adapters, async I/O, structured logging — eliminate the structural
debt rather than patching around it. The security improvements close the
PII-exposure and enumeration vulnerabilities. The TDD discipline produces
a regression-tested codebase rather than a hand-tested one. The OpenAPI
snapshot generated by the FastAPI app provides a machine-readable API
contract that future clients (a mobile rebuild, a third-party integration)
can consume without ambiguity.

## 3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet in Module One?

The Milestone Two work targets three of the five program outcomes most
directly, and makes incidental progress on the other two.

**Outcome 4 (well-founded techniques and tools for solutions that deliver
value) — Met.** The web rebuild uses React, TypeScript, FastAPI, Pydantic,
SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Vite, ruff, mypy, eslint, prettier, pre-commit, and
Playwright — every choice is current and industry-standard. The three-pattern
backend, the strict typing on both stacks, and the test-driven cadence
demonstrate engineering practices that scale beyond a course project.

**Outcome 5 (security mindset) — Met.** The authentication system addresses
every security finding from the Android code review with an explicit
countermeasure and an explicit test. Bcrypt password hashing, refresh-token
rotation with family revocation, generic error messages, PII masking, rate
limiting, account lockout, strict CORS, and security headers are all in
place from the first commit, documented in ADRs, and verified by tests.

**Outcome 2 (professional-quality written and visual communication) — Met.**
The SRS, the ADRs, the API documentation auto-generated from the OpenAPI
schema, the README, the CONTRIBUTING guide, the ARCHITECTURE summary, the
documentation index, and this narrative collectively demonstrate the
ability to communicate engineering decisions in writing to multiple
audiences (engineers, reviewers, stakeholders).

**Outcome 3 (algorithmic principles and trade-offs) — Partial.** Milestone
Two intentionally defers most of the algorithm and data-structure work to
Milestone Three. The M3 backlog, named explicitly in the M2 implementation
brief (§7 Out of Scope) and the SRS, includes a **sliding-window moving
average** for trend smoothing on the weight chart (FR-D-2), a
**milestone-detection algorithm** for goal-progress achievements
(FR-Ach-2), a **streak-detection algorithm** for consecutive-day logging
at 7 and 30 days (FR-Ach-3), a **composite-index strategy** for trend
queries on the time-series table, and **TTL-based server-side caching**
for the dashboard read model. The M2 contribution to Outcome 3 is the
**opaque compound cursor for weight-entry pagination** (ADR-0015), where
the trade-offs between offset and cursor pagination, and between
transparent and opaque cursors, are documented with the chosen
alternative justified; the cursor design is intended to generalize to the
broader time-series pagination work scheduled for M3.

**Outcome 1 (collaborative environments) — Partial.** The ADRs, the code
review checklist self-application, and the README written for an external
audience all contribute. The capstone is a solo project, so the full
collaborative outcome will surface in the workplace; the artifact
demonstrates that I produce work in a form that *would* support collaboration
(decision records, documentation, clean PR history, conventional commits).

I have no updates to the Module One outcome-coverage plan: the milestone
schedule (M2 = software engineering, M3 = algorithms, M4 = databases) maps
cleanly to the program outcomes, and the deferred items in M2 are exactly
the items planned to land in M3.

## 4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact

**What I learned during the rebuild.**

The biggest technical surprise was how much architectural drift becomes
visible — and unavoidable — when you write the test before the code and
enforce the dependency rule in CI. The three-pattern backend (Screaming +
Clean + Hexagonal, ADR-0012) sounds like ceremony on paper, but with
`import-linter` enforcing the rule that domain code may not import
FastAPI or SQLAlchemy, the architecture stopped being aspirational and
became something the build refuses to tolerate. The first time I tried to
shortcut by reaching into the ORM from a use case, the CI run failed in
under a minute. After a few of those, the pattern stuck. The same is true
of `mypy --strict`: it forces you to make explicit the contract every
public function carries, and the cost up front pays back every time a
caller refactors and the compiler rather than a runtime exception tells
you what broke.

The non-technical lesson was the value of writing the Architecture
Decision Record *before* the code that depends on it. ADR-0012 (the
three-pattern backend) was committed before Phase 4 wrote a single line
of the domain folder structure; ADR-0013 (refresh token rotation) was
committed before Phase 6 began the auth backend. In both cases, the act
of writing the ADR forced me to think through the alternatives — and in
both cases the chosen alternative ended up slightly different from what I
would have built on instinct. Writing it after the fact would have made
the record a justification rather than a decision document. Related: the
`SUMMARY.md` engineering log proved more useful than I expected. Commit
messages capture *what*; `SUMMARY.md` entries capture *why* and *what
went wrong* with enough room to actually explain. By the end of Phase 9,
the log had become the most useful single document for re-entering work
after a break.

**Challenges I faced.**

The most instructive challenge was the cursor pagination contract on
`GET /api/v1/weight-entries`. The first-cut implementation in Phase 8
used a transparent `entry_id` cursor, which the PR #30 review surfaced
as both leaking schema and skipping rows at page boundaries when two
entries shared a date. The fix took two passes: first patching the
boundary condition, then realizing the design itself was wrong and
authoring ADR-0015 (opaque compound cursor) to capture the corrected
contract. The lesson — pagination contracts are public API surface and
need an ADR up front, not after a reviewer catches them — is one I now
apply by default to anything client-facing.

A second category of challenge was the multi-agent code review on PR #30
that caught a soft-delete filter bug in `get_by_id`: the method was
returning soft-deleted entries, which meant a `DELETE` followed by a
`PUT` would silently resurrect a deleted row. Fixed in `ec22cf2` with
regression tests for `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE` on soft-deleted entries,
plus a separate `get_by_id_including_deleted` helper for the genuinely
idempotent `DELETE` path. The class of bug — "soft delete is a domain
invariant, not a query filter" — is now an explicit thing I check for
whenever I see `is_deleted` in a model.

A third challenge worth naming is the Phase 9 release-automation work
itself. The first design used `git-cliff` with a manual `git tag` step
to publish v0.1.0. A clarifying question from a reviewer surfaced the
problem: typing the version string by hand reintroduces exactly the
human-error vector the release pipeline is supposed to eliminate. I
reverted three commits and switched to `release-please`, which moves
the version decision into a reviewable Release PR. The meta-lesson was
about the *process* of choosing tooling — when I'm building automation,
the default question should be "what human decision is still in the
loop, and does it need to be?" — not "what's the simplest renderer I
can wire up?".

**How this work prepares me for the rest of the capstone.**

Milestone Two intentionally leaves room for the M3 and M4 work to plug
into clean seams rather than retrofit them. The opaque compound cursor
from ADR-0015 generalizes to other time-series queries M3 will need
(trend windows, goal-history pagination). The three-pattern backend
gives M3's algorithm modules — sliding-window moving average, milestone
detection, streak detection — a domain folder to live in where they
can be tested in isolation without the framework. The structured
logging strategy from ADR-0011 (PII masking) is the natural hook point
for the M4 audit log; the routing layer already produces the events,
M4 just needs to persist them. And the release-please pipeline that
landed in Phase 9 means v0.2.0 and v0.3.0 ship on the same automation
as v0.1.0 with no incremental release engineering — the marginal cost
of shipping a milestone is now reviewing one PR.
