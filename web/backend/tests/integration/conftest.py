"""Shared fixtures for integration tests.

Provides a TestClient wired to an in-memory SQLite database.  Each test
function receives a client that starts with a fresh, empty schema and is
isolated from other tests.

SQLite is used instead of PostgreSQL so that integration tests can run in CI
without a running database service.  A single shared connection is used for
the whole test so that create_all, the test code, and the route handlers all
operate on the same in-memory database.
