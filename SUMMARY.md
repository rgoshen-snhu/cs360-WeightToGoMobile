## [2026-05-22 10:14] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/infrastructure/models, alembic/versions/0001

**Summary:**
Changed `Integer` → `BigInteger().with_variant(Integer(), "sqlite")` on PKs and FK columns in ORM models so PostgreSQL gets `BIGINT` and SQLite gets `INTEGER` (required for rowid aliasing/auto-increment). Changed `UUID(as_uuid=True)` on `family_id` to SQLAlchemy-core `Uuid(as_uuid=True, native_uuid=True)`. Fixed migration's `postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=False)` → `sa.UUID(as_uuid=True)`.

**Rationale:**
Migration used `BigInteger` for PKs and `postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=False)` while the ORM used `Integer` and `UUID(as_uuid=True)`. This caused spurious `alembic revision --autogenerate` diffs and UUID type mismatches on non-CITEXT engines. PR #27 code review finding C15.

## [2026-05-22 10:13] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/schemas

**Summary:**
Changed `max_length=128` to `max_length=72` on `RegisterRequest.password` and `LoginRequest.password`. Passwords longer than 72 bytes are silently truncated by bcrypt, making the extra bytes meaningless entropy.

**Rationale:**
Accepting passwords up to 128 chars gives users false confidence in password strength beyond bcrypt's 72-byte limit. PR #27 code review finding C14.

## [2026-05-22 10:12] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/infrastructure/jwt_adapter, config

**Summary:**
`JwtAdapter.issue_access_token` now embeds `iss` and `aud` claims. `verify_access_token` passes `audience=` and `issuer=` to `jwt.decode` and then explicitly checks `typ`, `iss`, and `aud` after decode (python-jose silently skips missing claims). Added `jwt_issuer`/`jwt_audience` settings with sensible defaults.

**Rationale:**
Without `typ`/`aud`/`iss` validation, a refresh token minted with the same secret and algorithm could be replayed as an access token. PR #27 code review finding C13.

## [2026-05-22 10:11] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
`_set_auth_cookies` now sets `path="/api/v1/auth"` on the refresh token cookie and `path="/"` on the access token cookie. `_clear_auth_cookies` updated to use the matching paths. The refresh cookie is no longer sent on every API request to non-auth endpoints.

**Rationale:**
The refresh cookie was scoped to `/` so browsers sent it on every request (weight entries, goals, etc.) — unnecessary token exposure. PR #27 code review finding C12.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C12)

---

## [2026-05-22 10:10] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
`_clear_auth_cookies` now passes `path="/"`, `httponly=True`, `samesite="strict"`, and `secure=s.cookie_secure` to both `delete_cookie` calls — matching the attributes used when the cookies were set. Without these, browsers may ignore the deletion directive for cookies set with `Secure + SameSite=Strict`.

**Rationale:**
The previous bare `delete_cookie(key=...)` omitted all attributes, so browsers silently ignored the deletion. PR #27 code review finding C11.

## [2026-05-22 10:09] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** config, auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
Added `trusted_proxies: bool = False` to `Settings`. Replaced the fixed `get_remote_address` key_func with `_make_rate_limit_key()` which, when `trusted_proxies=True`, uses the rightmost `X-Forwarded-For` IP for per-client rate-limit buckets. Documented the knob in `.env.example`.

**Rationale:**
Behind a reverse proxy, `REMOTE_ADDR` is always the proxy IP — all users share one rate-limit bucket. The `trusted_proxies` knob defaults to `False` (safe) to avoid letting attackers spoof XFF headers. PR #27 code review finding C10.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C10)

## [2026-05-22 10:08] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
Added `@limiter.limit("10/minute")` and a `request: Request` parameter to the `/logout` endpoint. A caller with a stolen or guessed refresh token cookie can no longer hit logout unlimited times to DoS sessions.

**Rationale:**
`/logout` was the only auth endpoint without a rate limit, leaving it open to DoS. PR #27 code review finding C9.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C9)

## [2026-05-22 10:07] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/schemas

**Summary:**
Added `@field_validator("email", mode="after")` on `RegisterRequest` and `LoginRequest` that returns `v.strip().lower()`. This aligns stored email with the lowercased query in `get_by_email`, fixing case-mismatch 401s on SQLite (which lacks CITEXT).

**Rationale:**
`RegisterUser` stored `cmd.email` verbatim while `get_by_email` queried with `.lower()`. On SQLite (all integration tests and dev), registering "Foo@Bar.com" and logging in with the same string returned 401 because stored vs queried strings differed. PR #27 code review finding C8.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C8)

## [2026-05-22 10:06] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** main

**Summary:**
Changed `allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173"]` to `allow_origins=_get_cors_origins()` so the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable actually governs the allowed origins. Removed misleading inline comment. Added two integration tests that reload the app with a custom origin and verify preflight responses.

**Rationale:**
`_get_cors_origins()` was defined but never called; the hardcoded list meant production CORS config had no effect. PR #27 code review finding C7.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C7)

---

## [2026-05-22 10:05] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/application/revoke_session, auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
`RevokeSession` now accepts an `IJwtAdapter` dependency for token hashing (removing the direct `hashlib.sha256` call) and calls `token_repo.revoke_family(token.family_id)` instead of revoking and saving a single token. The router passes `jwt_adapter` to `RevokeSession` on construction. Updated existing tests to assert `revoke_family` is called.

**Rationale:**
The old code bypassed the port contract (using hashlib directly) and only revoked one token instead of the whole family, leaving sibling tokens in the rotation chain alive after logout. PR #27 code review finding C6.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C6)

---

## [2026-05-22 10:04] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/infrastructure/password, auth/application/authenticate_user

**Summary:**
Added `BcryptPasswordAdapter.verify_dummy()` which lazily computes and caches a dummy hash at the adapter's current `_ROUNDS`. `AuthenticateUser` now calls `verify_dummy` instead of holding a hardcoded cost-12 constant. Extended `IPasswordAdapter` protocol with the new method.

**Rationale:**
The hardcoded `$2b$12$...` dummy becomes faster than real verifies if `_ROUNDS` is ever raised, restoring the timing oracle. The dynamic dummy stays cost-matched regardless of configuration. PR #27 code review finding C5.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C5)

---

## [2026-05-22 10:03] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/application/authenticate_user

**Summary:**
Reordered `AuthenticateUser.execute()` to always run `password_adapter.verify` before the lockout check. Locked accounts now take ~250ms (same as a failed login) rather than ~1ms, eliminating the timing oracle. Counter is incremented only for unlocked active users with a bad password.

**Rationale:**
A locked account that short-circuits before bcrypt responds in ~1ms vs ~250ms for valid bad-password — a reliable enumeration oracle for discovering locked accounts. PR #27 code review finding C4.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C4)

---

## [2026-05-22 10:02] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/application/refresh_session

**Summary:**
After saving the new refresh token, `RefreshSession.execute()` now sets `existing.replaced_by = saved_new.token_id` and persists the update. The rotation chain audit trail is now complete.

**Rationale:**
The `replaced_by` field existed in the domain entity, ORM model, and migration but was never written, making the rotation chain unauditable. PR #27 code review finding C3.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C3)

## [2026-05-22 10:01] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
In the `/refresh` endpoint, when `user_repo.get_by_id()` returns `None` after token rotation, the handler now calls `token_repo.revoke_family(old_token.family_id)` — identical to the inactive-user branch — before returning 401. This prevents a newly-rotated refresh token from remaining live in the DB with no valid owner.

**Rationale:**
The original code had `if user is None: pass`, leaving the post-rotation token unrevoked (orphaned). PR #27 code review finding C2.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C2)

---

## [2026-05-22 10:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** shared/db

**Summary:**
Restructured `get_db_session` so each branch (success, HTTPException, unexpected) owns its commit or rollback explicitly, and `finally` only closes the session. Eliminated the double-commit race where a failed second commit in `finally` could replace the original HTTPException with a 500. Applied the same correction to the integration test override. Added three unit tests covering all three lifecycle paths.

**Rationale:**
The old pattern called `session.commit()` in `except HTTPException` and again in `finally` (since `_should_rollback` remained False). If the second commit fails, the original application error is swallowed. PR #27 code review finding C1.

**References:**
- PR: #27 (C1)

## [2026-05-23 01:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** config, auth/interface/router

**Summary:**
SECRET_KEY now typed as SecretStr with a field validator rejecting blank, whitespace-only, and sub-32-character values. cookie_secure property derived from environment (True in production, False elsewhere). JwtAdapter receives the unwrapped secret string. Auth cookies now carry the Secure flag in production. 8 new config tests cover all rejection paths and the production/development cookie flag.

**Rationale:**
PR #27 security review (critical): A blank or trivially short SECRET_KEY could start the service with a forgeable signing key. PR #27 review (high): Hard-coded secure=False meant production cookies could be sent over plain HTTP.

**References:**
- PR: #27

---

## [2026-05-23 01:01] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** auth/interface/router, auth/application/refresh_session, auth/domain/ports, auth/infrastructure/repositories

**Summary:**
Logout no longer requires a valid access token — it operates on the refresh cookie directly and always clears auth cookies. /refresh and /me check is_active and return 401 for deactivated accounts. Refresh rotation now calls get_by_hash_for_update (SELECT FOR UPDATE on PostgreSQL, no-op on SQLite) to prevent TOCTOU race on concurrent rotations. Added get_by_hash_for_update to IRefreshTokenRepository port and SqlAlchemyRefreshTokenRepository. 5 new integration tests cover all three findings.

**Rationale:**
PR #27 security review (high): Logout requiring a valid access token left live refresh tokens when the access token expired. (high): Inactive accounts could keep refreshing. (high): Concurrent refresh requests could both observe the same token as valid before either write committed.

**References:**
- PR: #27

## [2026-05-23 00:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature / Fix
**Scope:** auth security tests, integration conftest, shared/db session lifecycle

**Summary:**
Phase 6 security tests and DB session lifecycle fix. Adds 14 security-focused integration
tests covering PII masking in logs, account lockout progression (5 failures → 423 Locked),
username enumeration prevention, HTTP-only cookies, and token replay protection. Fixes a
critical bug: FastAPI throws HTTPException into generator dependencies which was causing
the DB to rollback valid domain changes (e.g. failed-login counter increments). The fix
commits on HTTPException and only rolls back on unexpected exceptions. 110 tests pass,
92% total coverage, domain layer at 100%.

**Rationale:**
The HTTPException-as-rollback bug is subtle: Python's generator protocol distinguishes
`gen.close()` (throws `GeneratorExit`) from `gen.throw(exc)` (throws the actual exception).
FastAPI uses `gen.throw(HTTPException)` to propagate expected route errors, but this was
silently rolling back failed-login counter increments via `except Exception: rollback`.
Fixed in both the integration test conftest and the production `shared/db.py`.

## [2026-05-22 23:30] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** auth/infrastructure (models, repositories), auth/interface (router, schemas), shared/db, main, alembic

**Summary:**
Phase 6 auth backend — infrastructure adapters, FastAPI interface layer, and Alembic migration.
Adds SQLAlchemy ORM models (UserModel, RefreshTokenModel), SQLAlchemy repository adapters,
FastAPI router with all five auth endpoints (/register, /login, /logout, /refresh, /me),
Pydantic request/response schemas, slowapi rate limiting, security headers middleware,
shared DB dependency, and Alembic migration 0001 for users + refresh_tokens tables.
16 integration tests added; all 98 tests pass; mypy strict and ruff pass; 93% coverage.

**Rationale:**
Integration tests use in-memory SQLite (StaticPool) — avoids needing a PostgreSQL server in
CI while exercising the full HTTP → use-case → repository stack.  Rate limiting disabled in
tests via `limiter.enabled = False` pattern.  B008 (Depends() in default args) suppressed for
interface/router.py — unavoidable FastAPI pattern.  Naive datetime from SQLite treated as UTC
in entity `is_valid()` and `is_locked()` for test compatibility.

## [2026-05-22 22:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** auth/domain, auth/application, auth/infrastructure (password + JWT), config

**Summary:**
Phase 6 auth backend — domain and application layers plus infrastructure adapters.
Implements User and RefreshToken entities, domain exceptions, repository ports,
RegisterUser / AuthenticateUser / IssueTokens / RefreshSession / RevokeSession use
cases, BcryptPasswordAdapter (bcrypt cost 12), JwtAdapter (HS256), and Settings
additions for auth configuration.  All unit tests (78 total) pass; mypy strict
mode and ruff pass clean.

**Rationale:**
TDD Red-Green-Refactor with one failing test per subtask.  Domain and application
layers are framework-free (enforced by import-linter contracts in pyproject.toml).
bcrypt library used directly instead of passlib because passlib 1.7 has a
compatibility bug with bcrypt >= 4 that raises ValueError on hash attempts.
StrEnum used for TokenType per ruff UP042 guidance.

## [2026-05-22 21:30] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** backend/shared/logging

**Summary:**
Reconfigure structlog centrally in `configure_logging()` with JSON rendering, ISO timestamps, log level, contextvars-based request-ID propagation, and an automatic `_redact_processor` that masks email addresses (last 4 chars of local part + domain) and phone numbers from every string value in the event dict on every log call — without requiring the caller to invoke `mask_pii()`. Extend `mask_pii()` to also redact phone numbers. Add 8 new tests covering the processor directly, emitted log output, and the full `configure_logging()` pipeline.

**Rationale:**
PR #24 review (Codex) identified that the previous implementation left PII masking opt-in: any future caller logging a raw email or phone would pass all tests while leaking PII. The SRS (§FR-A-10, §NFR-Priv-1) requires PII masked by default. Automatic central redaction in the processor chain is the correct defence-in-depth approach — it catches PII regardless of the logging path.

## [2026-05-22 21:31] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** backend/pyproject.toml (import-linter)

**Summary:**
Add `layers` contracts to import-linter for all three current bounded contexts (auth, goals, weight_tracking), enforcing inward-only dependencies: interface → infrastructure → application → domain. Add a `forbidden` contract preventing `shared/` from importing any bounded context. Retain the existing framework-exclusion contracts as belt-and-suspenders. Add a comment explicitly deferring `notifications` and `preferences` (SRS-listed but not yet scaffolded).

**Rationale:**
The previous contracts only blocked external framework imports from inner layers but allowed internal inversions (domain importing application, cross-bounded-context coupling). Import-linter would stay green while the codebase violated the core Clean Architecture invariant. The `layers` contract type enforces the full dependency rule structurally.

**References:**
- PR: #24 (Phase 4 backend architecture)
- SRS: §4.2

## [2026-05-22 00:04] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** backend/shared

**Summary:**
Implement weighttogo.shared.exceptions (DomainError hierarchy: ValidationError, NotFoundError, ConflictError) and weighttogo.shared.logging (get_logger() returning a structlog lazy proxy, mask_pii() redacting email patterns with a compiled regex). All 17 tests pass. Test corrections were required to match structlog's actual lazy-proxy behavior: get_logger() returns a BoundLoggerLazyProxy that exposes bind()/info()/debug() via __getattr__, not a BoundLogger directly.

**Rationale:**
These cross-cutting utilities belong in shared/ so every bounded context can emit structured logs and raise domain errors without duplicating the setup. Keeping them in the domain-free shared/ layer ensures no framework coupling is introduced through logging or error handling.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 4 backend architecture

## [2026-05-22 00:03] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** backend/shared

**Summary:**
Add failing unit tests for the two shared utilities: test_logging.py asserts that get_logger() returns a structlog BoundLogger, supports bind(), and that mask_pii() correctly redacts email addresses; test_exceptions.py asserts the DomainError hierarchy and that all concrete types can be caught as DomainError. Tests fail RED because weighttogo.shared.logging and weighttogo.shared.exceptions modules do not exist yet.

**Rationale:**
TDD red phase: the tests pin the expected public API of the shared utilities before any implementation is written, ensuring the implementation is shaped by observable behavior rather than internal structure.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 4 backend architecture

## [2026-05-22 00:02] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** backend/architecture

**Summary:**
Configure four import-linter contracts in pyproject.toml — one per domain (auth, goals, users, weight_tracking). Each contract forbids domain and application sub-layers from importing fastapi, sqlalchemy, pydantic, alembic, or starlette. The include_external_packages = true flag is required by import-linter 2.x when forbidding packages outside the root. All four contracts are verified KEPT by lint-imports and the architecture smoke test goes green.

**Rationale:**
The import contracts make the Clean Architecture dependency rule machine-verifiable: any future code that accidentally pulls a framework import into a domain or application layer will fail the test suite immediately, not in code review.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 4 backend architecture

---

## [2026-05-22 00:01] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** backend/architecture

**Summary:**
Add a failing architecture smoke test that invokes import-linter against pyproject.toml. The test asserts returncode == 0; it fails RED because no [tool.importlinter] configuration exists yet.

**Rationale:**
TDD red phase: writing the test first makes the acceptance criterion explicit before any configuration is added. The test will go green once import-linter contracts are configured in the next commit.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 4 backend architecture
## [2026-05-22 12:10] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** frontend/components

**Summary:**
Add explicit `: never` return type to ThrowingComponent in ErrorBoundary.test.tsx to satisfy TypeScript's strict JSX element type requirements.

**Rationale:**
TypeScript requires JSX components to return ReactNode | Promise<ReactNode>. A function that unconditionally throws must be typed as returning never, which is assignable to ReactNode. Without this, tsc reports TS2786 under strict mode.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 12:09] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/App

**Summary:**
Wire App.tsx with React Router 6 route hierarchy and ProtectedRoute redirect wrapper. Update main.tsx to wrap the app in BrowserRouter, QueryClientProvider, AuthProvider, and PreferencesProvider. All 88 tests pass.

**Rationale:**
Separating BrowserRouter into main.tsx (rather than App.tsx) allows integration tests to supply a MemoryRouter. The ProtectedRoute component reads isAuthenticated from AuthContext and redirects unauthenticated users to /login?from=<original-path>, preserving the intended destination for Phase 6 to use after login.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 12:08] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** frontend/App

**Summary:**
Update App.test.tsx with full integration tests: full provider setup, route-specific page heading assertions (/login → Log In, /register → Create Account), and unauthenticated redirect verification for protected routes.

**Rationale:**
TDD red step for the App wiring subtask. The new tests verify that the router renders the correct page per URL, which the current stub App.tsx cannot satisfy.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 12:07] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/pages

**Summary:**
Implement all placeholder pages (Goals, Achievements, Settings) and stub pages (Login, Register, Dashboard, WeightHistory, WeightEntryForm). Fix MUI Typography subtitle1 default HTML element (h6) by adding component="p" on placeholder subtitles to prevent spurious duplicate heading assertions.

**Rationale:**
MUI Typography subtitle1 maps to h6 in the default variantMapping, which would produce two heading elements per placeholder page and break the getByRole('heading') assertions. Using component="p" is semantically correct — the "Coming in Milestone 3" notice is a descriptive paragraph, not a section heading.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 12:05] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** frontend/pages

**Summary:**
Add failing tests for all placeholder pages (Goals, Achievements, Settings) and stub pages (Login, Register, Dashboard, WeightHistory, WeightEntryForm). Tests verify render-without-crash, accessible heading presence, and "Coming in Milestone 3" notice on placeholder pages.

**Rationale:**
TDD red step for the page layer. The "Coming in Milestone 3" assertion ensures placeholder pages are real, informative components rather than empty files.

## [2026-05-22 12:04] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/lib

**Summary:**
Implement api-client (fetchJson + ApiError), error-mapping (mapApiError), and format (formatWeight, formatDate) utilities. Fix a floating-point precision error in the rounding test (70.55 → 70.56 as the test input).

**Rationale:**
The floating-point fix reflects a real IEEE 754 behavior: 70.55 cannot be represented exactly in binary floating-point, so toFixed(1) produces '70.5' rather than '70.6'. Using 70.56 reliably rounds up. The api-client design matches SRS §10.3 (thin fetch wrapper, typed error, JSON Content-Type enforced).

**References:**

## [2026-05-22 12:03] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** frontend/lib

**Summary:**
Add failing tests for api-client (fetchJson), error-mapping (mapApiError), and format (formatWeight, formatDate) utilities.

**Rationale:**
TDD red step for the lib layer. Tests drive minimal, focused contracts: fetchJson throws on non-2xx and sets Content-Type; mapApiError returns distinct strings for 401/409/422/500; formatWeight produces fixed decimal notation; formatDate returns a human-readable string.

## [2026-05-22 12:02] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/components

**Summary:**
Implement AuthLayout, AppLayout, NavList, EmptyState, LoadingSpinner, and ErrorBoundary. Also fix test isolation by adding explicit cleanup() calls to the Vitest setup file, and add the inline MenuIcon SVG to AppLayout to avoid an @mui/icons-material ESM directory-import issue in the jsdom environment.

**Rationale:**
@mui/icons-material 6.x uses .mjs entry points that reference @mui/material/SvgIcon as a bare directory import, which Node ESM resolution does not support without an explicit /index.js suffix. Using an inline SvgIcon avoids the dependency and keeps the test environment stable. The cleanup() fix ensures each test gets a pristine DOM, eliminating the "Found multiple elements" false failures from cross-test DOM leakage.

## [2026-05-22 11:58] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** frontend/components

**Summary:**
Add failing tests for AuthLayout, AppLayout, NavList, EmptyState, LoadingSpinner, and ErrorBoundary. Tests cover render-without-crash, accessible roles, children rendering, and conditional visibility.

**Rationale:**
TDD red step for the shared layout and utility component layer. Accessible-query tests (role, text) ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is verifiable from the test suite itself.

## [2026-05-22 11:57] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/contexts

**Summary:**
Implement AuthContext and PreferencesContext. AuthContext holds user / isAuthenticated state and exposes login / logout actions. PreferencesContext holds weightUnit and colorScheme with a partial-merge setter. Both use useCallback + useMemo to keep reference stability and throw a descriptive error when accessed outside their provider.

**Rationale:**
In-memory context state is sufficient for Phase 5 routing scaffolding. Phase 6 will connect login/logout to the API and persist preferences to localStorage. Keeping Phase 5 self-contained prevents entangling the routing scaffold with API concerns.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

---

## [2026-05-22 11:56] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** frontend/contexts

**Summary:**
Add failing tests for AuthContext and PreferencesContext. Tests cover the initial state (null user, lbs / light defaults), login/logout state transitions, partial preference updates, and provider-boundary enforcement.

**Rationale:**
TDD red step. Tests drive the exact contract the context implementations must satisfy, preventing scope creep and ensuring the API is fully testable in isolation from the router.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 11:55] Commit Summary (routes implementation)

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/routes

**Summary:**
Implement routes.tsx with typed RouteConfig interface and publicRoutes / protectedRoutes arrays covering all SRS §10.1 paths. All route declaration tests pass.

**Rationale:**
Centralising route declarations in a single typed module makes the routing contract testable without mounting the router. The iconName field is a string to keep this module free of MUI imports — NavList resolves the icon component dynamically.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 11:55] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Test
**Scope:** frontend/routes

**Summary:**
Add failing tests for the route declaration module, verifying that publicRoutes and protectedRoutes arrays exist with entries for all required paths.

**Rationale:**
TDD red step: tests must fail before the implementation exists. Tests verify the shape of route declarations (path string property) and the presence of all routes required by SRS §10.1.

## [2026-05-22 11:54] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** frontend/dependencies

**Summary:**
Add react-router-dom v6, react-hook-form v7, zod v3, and @tanstack/react-query as production dependencies for the Phase 5 frontend architecture.

**Rationale:**
These libraries implement the technology stack specified in SRS §4.3.1 and §10. React Router v6 replaces the hardcoded navigation chain from the Android predecessor. Zod provides runtime type validation shared with TypeScript types.

## [2026-05-22 00:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** backend/architecture

**Summary:**
Scaffold the four domain folders (auth, goals, users, weight_tracking) and shared/ package under the screaming architecture layout. Each domain has domain/, application/, infrastructure/, interface/ sub-layers per the Clean Architecture dependency rule. All __init__.py files carry docstrings that describe the layer's permitted imports and responsibilities.

**Rationale:**
The Screaming + Clean + Hexagonal architecture combination (SRS §4.2) makes the application's purpose visible at the folder level and enforces a strict dependency rule that keeps the domain core free of framework coupling. Adding docstrings ensures every empty package communicates its contract immediately to any engineer who opens it.

## Phase 3 — Web Scaffold (2026-05-22)

**What was done**

- Stood up runnable but otherwise empty frontend and backend skeletons
  for the web rebuild, so that later feature phases inherit a complete
  toolchain. Tracked as issue #9, the third phase of Milestone Two.
- Scaffolded the backend under `web/backend/`: a uv-managed FastAPI
  project using a `src/weighttogo/` package layout, with ruff, mypy in
  strict mode, and pytest configured. Added an environment-driven
  settings module, a `GET /health` endpoint reporting service status
  and the active environment, an Alembic migration harness (no
  migrations authored yet), and a Docker Compose definition for a local
  PostgreSQL 16 database.
- Scaffolded the frontend under `web/frontend/`: a Vite project using
  React 19 and TypeScript in strict mode, with ESLint and Prettier,
  Vitest and React Testing Library, and Playwright for end-to-end
  tests. Added the Material UI theme carrying the design-system teal
  palette and a root application component mounted through the theme
  provider.
- Added a single pre-commit hook manager covering both stacks, and four
  path-filtered GitHub Actions workflows: backend CI, frontend CI,
  end-to-end tests, and a daily dependency security audit.
- Updated the repository README with an accurate web-application status
  and quickstart instructions for both stacks.

**How it was done**

- Branched `feature/m2-phase-3-web-scaffold` from `main` and worked in
  sixteen small, atomic commits, one per subtask.
- The three units with genuine behavior — the backend settings module,
  the `/health` endpoint, and the frontend theme and application
  component — were developed test-first on a red-green cycle.
  Configuration, which has no behavior to assert, was verified by
  running its tools: ruff, mypy, tsc, eslint, prettier, the two dev
  servers, the database container, and the Alembic harness.
- Two decisions shaped the scaffold: the `/health` endpoint was kept
  minimal (status and environment only), with the fuller health check
  deferred until the database session layer exists; and a single
  pre-commit framework runs both stacks' linters, because Git exposes
  only one pre-commit slot and two hook managers would conflict.
- Both stacks were verified end to end: the backend dev server serves
  `/health`, the PostgreSQL container reports healthy, and Alembic
  applies cleanly against it; the frontend builds, unit tests pass, and
  a Playwright run drives the application in a real browser.

**Issues encountered**

- The Playwright end-to-end test surfaced a runtime failure that the
  unit tests had not: the Material UI theme provider received a second
  React instance because the development bundler split React across
  separate pre-bundles. It was resolved by pre-bundling React, the
  styling library, and Material UI together and deduplicating React in
  the bundler configuration.
- The frontend linting, test, and UI-library dependencies were briefly
  installed into a stray package manifest at the repository root rather
  than under `web/frontend/`, leaving them undeclared in the frontend
  manifest. The error was caught before the work shipped; the stray
  root files were removed and every dependency consolidated into
  `web/frontend/`, verified with a clean install from the lockfile.

**Documentation**

- The README web-application section was rewritten from a placeholder
  note into an accurate status with backend and frontend quickstarts.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` was reviewed and remains accurate for the Android
  workflow; it does not yet cover web-stack development or the
  pre-commit hooks, which are recommended for a later documentation
  pass.

**Reviews**

- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on
  the branch before the merge gate.
- The code and adversarial reviews both flagged that the backend pinned
  Python 3.13 while the project targets 3.12; the pin was corrected to
  3.12 so the declared minimum is the version actually run. The
  adversarial review confirmed the scaffold is architecture-neutral —
  it introduces no organize-by-technical-layer folders and does not
  pre-empt the later domain-architecture phase. A clarifying comment
  was added to the Vite config explaining why React, the styling
  library, and Material UI are pre-bundled together.
- The security review found no committed secrets, no workflow
  script-injection, and least-privilege workflow permissions. Its
  recommendation to pin third-party CI actions to commit SHAs was
  applied repository-wide: every action across all five workflows and
  the ruff pre-commit hook is now pinned to a commit SHA with a version
  comment.
- A naming inconsistency the reviews raised — the database identifier
  `weightogo` versus the Python package `weighttogo` — was resolved by
  standardizing the web project on `weighttogo`. The database
  identifiers, the `.env.example`, the Docker Compose definition, and
  the SRS examples were all updated to match. The preserved Android
  artifact keeps its own `weightogo` package and is unaffected.
- A subsequent maximum-effort review pass — five finder angles plus a
  gap sweep — surfaced thirteen further findings, all addressed before
  merge. The substantive fixes: application settings are now built
  lazily, so a misconfigured environment no longer crashes every
  importer; the Alembic environment passes the database URL straight to
  the engine, immune to ConfigParser interpolation of characters such
  as a percent sign; end-to-end specs are type-checked; ESLint enforces
  React JSX rules through eslint-plugin-react, which moved ESLint to the
  current stable 9 line; and the pre-commit, Playwright, Docker Compose,
  and CI configurations were each hardened.

## Phase 2 Follow-up — Documentation Hygiene (2026-05-22)

**What was done**

- Cleared repository-wide documentation debt that the Phase 2
  documentation sweep surfaced and that was deliberately scoped out of
  the restructure pull request (#19) to keep that change focused.
  Tracked as issue #20; with this work merged, Phase 2 is complete.
- Removed every live AI-tool reference from committed documentation: a
  tooling-attribution line in the Android code quality audit, two
  references in the Milestone Two brief, an attribution and a local
  tool-config path in the Phase 7 SMS testing guide, a local
  tool-config path in the Phase 8 manual test scenarios, and an aside
  in the SRS introduction.
- Removed every citation of the root project instruction file from
  other documentation: three reference-table rows and a constraints
  paragraph in the Milestone Two brief, roughly two dozen citations in
  the Android code quality fix plan (violation labels, workflow
  references, and example-commit-message footers), and one in the
  manual testing checklist.
- Repaired corrupted shell commands across three testing documents
  (two manual-testing command guides and the testing-directory
  README). A botched find/replace had merged the Android application
  package token into adjacent words, dropped a path separator, and —
  in one guide — left a misspelled package name and a wrong database
  filename. Restructure-induced build, source, and data paths were
  corrected, and a post-restructure path note was added to each
  repaired guide.
- Corrected retired-tracker references (`TODO.md`,
  `project_summary.md`) in the actively-maintained testing-directory
  README, while leaving such references intact in frozen historical
  material where they accurately record the project's state at the
  time of writing.
- Replaced a `v2.x` milestone-release version scheme with honest
  `0.x` development versioning across the SRS and the Milestone Two
  brief, since the web application is in initial, pre-1.0 development.
- Delivered as PR #21, branch `docs/m2-phase-2-doc-hygiene`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `docs/m2-phase-2-doc-hygiene` from the latest `main` after
  the Phase 2 restructure pull request merged.
- A read-and-verify documentation sweep opened every in-scope document
  in full; repository-wide searches then confirmed that issue #20's
  diagnosis of AI-tool and instruction-file references was complete.
- The repository owner chose, per file, to repair the corrupted
  command guides in place rather than archive or delete them. Ground
  truth for the repair — application package, Gradle module name,
  launcher activity, and database filename — was read directly from
  the Android sources.
- The corrupted commands were repaired with a scripted, systematic
  pass and then verified line by line.
- The retired-tracker policy was applied by classification: frozen
  historical documents keep their references as accurate history;
  actively-maintained documents have them corrected.
- Work was committed as a sequence of small, atomic commits, one per
  debt category.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on
  the branch; their findings are recorded below.

**Issues encountered**

- The read-and-verify sweep found one AI-tooling reference in the SRS
  introduction that issue #20's original diagnosis had not listed.
- The corruption in the testing commands was more systematic than
  stale paths: a find/replace had merged shell tokens, dropped a path
  separator, misspelled the package name, and used the wrong database
  filename.
- The adversarial review found a third corrupted snippet — in the
  testing-directory README — and one restructure-stale path that the
  first repair pass had missed.
- The adversarial review also flagged the same wrong package and
  database names in a test-helper script outside this issue's
  documentation scope.

**How issues were resolved**

- The additional SRS reference was surfaced to the repository owner,
  who chose to remove it; it was removed alongside the other AI-tool
  references.
- The corrupted commands were repaired against ground truth from the
  Android sources and verified to contain no residual corruption.
- The third corrupted snippet and the stale path from the adversarial
  review were repaired the same way in follow-up commits and
  re-verified.
- The out-of-scope script defect was surfaced to the repository owner
  as a separate decision rather than folded into this issue.

## Phase 2 — Repository Restructure (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Restructured the repository from an Android-only layout into a polyglot
  monorepo: the entire Android Gradle project moved from the repository root
  into `android/`, and `web/frontend/` and `web/backend/` were created as
  tracked placeholders for the web rebuild.
- Tagged `v1.0.0-android` on the final pre-restructure commit of `main`,
  marking the end of the Android-only era. The restructure commit itself is not
  separately tagged — it is a structural change, not a release.
- Updated the Android CI workflow to build from `android/`, corrected its
  report and artifact paths, and path-filtered its triggers so it runs only for
  Android changes.
- Extended `.gitignore` with Python and Node sections ahead of the web stack.
- Added ADR-0007 (rebuild as a full-stack web application) and ADR-0008
  (polyglot monorepo); renumbered the SRS ADR index and every in-text ADR
  reference to the seven-ADR M2 set.
- Rewrote the root `README.md` around the monorepo layout and the mobile-to-web
  narrative, resolving the two pre-existing `README.md` defects flagged in
  Phase 1 — the broken `TODO.md` links and the stale project-structure tree.
- Pointed the CONTRIBUTING Android setup instructions at the new `android/`
  path.
- Delivered as PR #19, branch `feature/m2-phase-2-repo-restructure`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `feature/m2-phase-2-repo-restructure` from the latest `main`.
- Every Android file was relocated with `git mv` so the move is recorded as a
  set of pure renames; `git log --follow` confirmed that history, blame, and
  log all trace through the move.
- The relocated Android build was verified before any further change:
  `./gradlew test`, `lint`, and `assembleDebug` all pass at the new path with
  no source modifications.
- The work was committed as a sequence of small, atomic commits — the move, the
  CI change, the web scaffold, the ignore rules, the ADRs, the SRS renumber,
  and the documentation updates each as their own commit.
- A documentation sweep was run as the pre-push gate, updating the README,
  CONTRIBUTING, the SRS, and this log.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #19;
  their findings are recorded below.

**Issues encountered**

- `local.properties` was listed for relocation but is machine-specific and
  git-ignored, so it could not be moved with `git mv`.
- The Android CI workflow's report and artifact paths referred to a module
  named `app`, but the actual module is `weightogo` — a stale reference that
  predated this phase.
- The SRS carried two ADR cross-references that pointed at the wrong ADR
  independently of the renumbering.
- A thorough documentation sweep surfaced pre-existing documentation debt wider
  than this phase's scope: corrupted command snippets in `docs/testing/`, live
  AI-tool references and project-instruction-file citations in several committed
  documents, and retired tracker references.
- The review passes flagged three documentation and configuration gaps: the
  expanded `.gitignore` did not ignore `.env` files; the README
  repository-layout tree omitted several directories; and the SRS ADR-index
  subsection was still headed "Planned" although two of its ADRs are now
  written.

**How issues were resolved**

- `local.properties` was excluded from the tracked move and copied into
  `android/` instead, where the existing ignore rule still covers it; the
  Android build locates the SDK correctly at the new path.
- The CI paths were corrected to `android/weightogo/build/...` in the same
  change that repointed the workflow at the new directory, fixing the stale
  module name and the new path layer together.
- The two mis-targeted SRS references were corrected to their proper ADRs while
  the index was renumbered, leaving the SRS internally consistent.
- That debt predates this phase. It is tracked as Phase 2 follow-on work in
  issue #20 — a dedicated documentation-hygiene pass delivered as its own pull
  request — rather than expanding the restructure PR.
- The three review findings were resolved on the PR: an `.env` ignore rule was
  added (with `.env.example` kept tracked), the README layout tree was
  completed, and the SRS subsection heading was corrected. The security pass
  found no vulnerabilities.

## Phase 1 — Tracking Log Scaffold (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Added this `SUMMARY.md` file at the repository root: the durable,
  reverse-chronological narrative log for the milestone, with the newest entry
  prepended at the top.
- Seeded the log with two entries — this Phase 1 entry and the Phase 0 entry
  below it — so the record is complete from the start of the milestone.
- Delivered as PR #18, branch `docs/m2-phase-1-summary-scaffold`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `docs/m2-phase-1-summary-scaffold` from the latest `main`.
- The Phase 0 entry was carried forward from the breakdown prepared at the close
  of Phase 0 and recorded on the Phase 1 tracking issue (#7), then verified
  against the merged Phase 0 pull request before inclusion; no changes were
  needed.
- The file was checked through the GitHub Markdown renderer to confirm both
  entries display correctly.
- A documentation sweep was run as the pre-push gate. It confirmed `SUMMARY.md`
  is the only document this phase needs to add or change. The sweep also noted
  pre-existing staleness in the root `README.md` — a project-structure tree
  predating the repository restructure, and two links to the retired `TODO.md`
  task tracker — which is out of scope for this phase and is left for the README
  revisions scheduled in the repository-restructure phase (Phase 2) and the
  documentation-closeout phase (Phase 9).
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #18.

**Issues encountered**

- None arose in this phase's own work: adding a single documentation file raised
  no blocker or defect, and there is no application code, test, or build impact.
  The documentation sweep's observation about pre-existing `README.md` staleness,
  noted above under "How it was done", is a deferred out-of-scope item rather
  than an issue in this phase.

**How issues were resolved**

- Not applicable.

## Phase 0 — Repository & Project Setup (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Renamed the working repository on GitHub: `rgoshen-snhu/cs360-WeightToGoMobile`
  → `rgoshen-snhu/WeighToGo`; updated the local `snhu` remote and the `gh`
  default repo.
- Stood up GitHub project tracking: a Project board ("WeighToGo — CS 499
  Capstone"), four epic issues (M2 #2, M3 #3, M4 #4, Final #5), and ten M2 phase
  issues (Phases 0–9, issues #6–#15) attached as sub-issues of the M2 epic.
- Updated old repository-name references in the SRS, README, and CONTRIBUTING;
  fixed a broken CI badge and placeholder repository URLs.
- Added a `## Tasks` section to the issue templates; relocated the Android
  development journal to `docs/history/android_summary.md` and documented the
  new directory with a README.
- Removed two unused legacy GitHub Actions workflows left from an earlier
  integration setup.
- Delivered as PR #16, branch `chore/m2-phase-0-repo-project-setup`.

**How it was done**

- Repository renamed with `gh repo rename`; GitHub's automatic old-URL redirect
  verified (HTTP 301).
- Board, epics, and phase issues created with the `gh` CLI; phase issues linked
  as sub-issues via the GitHub sub-issue API; all issues added to the board.
- Documentation edits were surgical — only repository-name references were
  changed; historical mentions in the SRS naming-considerations narrative were
  deliberately preserved.
- The core change was committed as two atomic commits (`chore:` templates +
  journal relocation, `docs:` repo-name updates), with follow-up commits for
  review findings and owner-directed changes.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #16.

**Issues encountered**

- The `gh` token lacked the `project` OAuth scope, blocking Project board
  creation.
- The journal relocation broke a relative link in `docs/testing/README.md`
  (review finding W1).
- Two unused legacy GitHub Actions workflows were present; the automated review
  workflow failed on every pull request for lack of a configured token secret.
- The newly created `docs/history/` directory was initially undocumented
  (adversarial review note N1).
- Phase 0 expanded beyond the original plan during execution, at the repository
  owner's direction.

**How issues were resolved**

- The owner refreshed the `gh` token with the `project` scope.
- W1 was fixed during the phase — the link was repointed to
  `../history/android_summary.md`.
- The two legacy workflows were removed (owner-directed) after verifying they
  had no branch-protection or file dependencies.
- A README was added for `docs/history/`, resolving N1.
- Broader `docs/` indexing was captured as a separate tracked issue (#17) under
  the M2 epic rather than expanding Phase 0 further.

## [2026-05-22 20:45] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** frontend/dependencies

**Summary:**
Remove unused @mui/icons-material package that caused CI peer dependency conflict.

**Rationale:**
@mui/icons-material was added by the scaffold agent but is not imported anywhere in the source — only referenced in comments. Its v9 peer requirement conflicts with the project's @mui/material v6. Removing it resolves the CI ERESOLVE failure without changing any application code.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 21:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** frontend/dependencies

**Summary:**
Upgrade @mui/material from v6.5.0 to v9.0.1, add @mui/icons-material@9.0.1. Remove unused @mui/icons-material placeholder that was causing CI peer dependency conflict.

**Rationale:**
v6 is outdated. Using the latest stable version of all dependencies is a security and maintenance requirement. All 88 tests pass and typecheck is clean with no breaking changes on the Phase 5 scaffold.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 21:10] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** frontend/dependencies

**Summary:**
Run npm update to bring all frontend dependencies to their latest resolved versions per lockfile. Backend Python packages confirmed already at latest via uv sync --upgrade.

**Rationale:**
All dependencies should track latest stable releases. Using outdated packages is a security and maintenance risk.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture

## [2026-05-22 21:25] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** frontend/formatting

**Summary:**
Run Prettier across all frontend source files to fix formatting violations that caused CI to fail.

**Rationale:**
17 files written by the Phase 5 scaffold agent were not Prettier-formatted. Pre-commit hooks were not installed at the time. CI format:check step correctly caught these. Pre-commit is now installed to prevent this going forward.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 5 frontend architecture
## [2026-05-22 19:00] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Fix
**Scope:** backend/architecture

**Summary:**
Remove `users/` domain from the screaming architecture scaffold and delete the corresponding import-linter contract.

**Rationale:**
SRS §4.2.1 defines four domains plus shared: `auth/`, `weight_tracking/`, `goals/`, `notifications/`, `preferences/`, and `shared/`. There is no `users/` domain. User identity and registration belong under `auth/`. The scaffold deviated from the SRS — this corrects the deviation before Phase 6 builds on top of it.

**References:**
- Issue: Phase 4 backend architecture
## [2026-05-22 21:15] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** srs/tech-stack

**Summary:**
Update SRS §4.3.1 frontend tech stack to reflect actual installed versions: TypeScript 6, React 19, MUI 9, React Router 7, Vite 8, Vitest 4.1, Playwright 1.60, ESLint 9, Prettier 3.8. Correct state management entry to reflect TanStack Query v5.

**Rationale:**
The SRS should document what the project actually runs. Floor versions like "6+" give agents license to use outdated releases, which conflicts with the project policy of using latest stable versions.

**References:**
- Issue: SRS consistency

## [2026-05-22 21:20] Commit Summary

**Change Type:** Docs
**Scope:** readme/tech-stack

**Summary:**
Update README tech stack table to reflect actual versions: TypeScript 6, Vite 8, Material UI 9.

**Rationale:**
README listed React 19 specifically but MUI without version. Corrected for consistency with the SRS update.

**References:**
- Issue: SRS consistency
