## Phase 2 — Repository Restructure (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Restructured the repository from an Android-only layout into a polyglot
  monorepo: the entire Android Gradle project moved from the repository root
  into `android/`, and `web/frontend/` and `web/backend/` were created as
  tracked placeholders for the web rebuild.
- Tagged `v1.0.0-android` on the final pre-restructure commit of `main`,
  marking the end of the Android-only era. The restructure commit itself is not
  separately tagged — it is a structural change, not a release.
- Updated the Android CI workflow to build from `android/`, corrected its
  report and artifact paths, and path-filtered its triggers so it runs only for
  Android changes.
- Extended `.gitignore` with Python and Node sections ahead of the web stack.
- Added ADR-0007 (rebuild as a full-stack web application) and ADR-0008
  (polyglot monorepo); renumbered the SRS ADR index and every in-text ADR
  reference to the seven-ADR M2 set.
- Rewrote the root `README.md` around the monorepo layout and the mobile-to-web
  narrative, resolving the two pre-existing `README.md` defects flagged in
  Phase 1 — the broken `TODO.md` links and the stale project-structure tree.
- Pointed the CONTRIBUTING Android setup instructions at the new `android/`
  path.
- Delivered as PR #19, branch `feature/m2-phase-2-repo-restructure`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `feature/m2-phase-2-repo-restructure` from the latest `main`.
- Every Android file was relocated with `git mv` so the move is recorded as a
  set of pure renames; `git log --follow` confirmed that history, blame, and
  log all trace through the move.
- The relocated Android build was verified before any further change:
  `./gradlew test`, `lint`, and `assembleDebug` all pass at the new path with
  no source modifications.
- The work was committed as a sequence of small, atomic commits — the move, the
  CI change, the web scaffold, the ignore rules, the ADRs, the SRS renumber,
  and the documentation updates each as their own commit.
- A documentation sweep was run as the pre-push gate, updating the README,
  CONTRIBUTING, the SRS, and this log.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #19;
  their findings are recorded below.

**Issues encountered**

- `local.properties` was listed for relocation but is machine-specific and
  git-ignored, so it could not be moved with `git mv`.
- The Android CI workflow's report and artifact paths referred to a module
  named `app`, but the actual module is `weightogo` — a stale reference that
  predated this phase.
- The SRS carried two ADR cross-references that pointed at the wrong ADR
  independently of the renumbering.
- A thorough documentation sweep surfaced pre-existing documentation debt wider
  than this phase's scope: corrupted command snippets in `docs/testing/`, live
  AI-tool references and project-instruction-file citations in several committed
  documents, and retired tracker references.
- The review passes flagged three documentation and configuration gaps: the
  expanded `.gitignore` did not ignore `.env` files; the README
  repository-layout tree omitted several directories; and the SRS ADR-index
  subsection was still headed "Planned" although two of its ADRs are now
  written.

**How issues were resolved**

- `local.properties` was excluded from the tracked move and copied into
  `android/` instead, where the existing ignore rule still covers it; the
  Android build locates the SDK correctly at the new path.
- The CI paths were corrected to `android/weightogo/build/...` in the same
  change that repointed the workflow at the new directory, fixing the stale
  module name and the new path layer together.
- The two mis-targeted SRS references were corrected to their proper ADRs while
  the index was renumbered, leaving the SRS internally consistent.
- That debt predates this phase. It is tracked as Phase 2 follow-on work in
  issue #20 — a dedicated documentation-hygiene pass delivered as its own pull
  request — rather than expanding the restructure PR.
- The three review findings were resolved on the PR: an `.env` ignore rule was
  added (with `.env.example` kept tracked), the README layout tree was
  completed, and the SRS subsection heading was corrected. The security pass
  found no vulnerabilities.

## Phase 1 — Tracking Log Scaffold (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Added this `SUMMARY.md` file at the repository root: the durable,
  reverse-chronological narrative log for the milestone, with the newest entry
  prepended at the top.
- Seeded the log with two entries — this Phase 1 entry and the Phase 0 entry
  below it — so the record is complete from the start of the milestone.
- Delivered as PR #18, branch `docs/m2-phase-1-summary-scaffold`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `docs/m2-phase-1-summary-scaffold` from the latest `main`.
- The Phase 0 entry was carried forward from the breakdown prepared at the close
  of Phase 0 and recorded on the Phase 1 tracking issue (#7), then verified
  against the merged Phase 0 pull request before inclusion; no changes were
  needed.
- The file was checked through the GitHub Markdown renderer to confirm both
  entries display correctly.
- A documentation sweep was run as the pre-push gate. It confirmed `SUMMARY.md`
  is the only document this phase needs to add or change. The sweep also noted
  pre-existing staleness in the root `README.md` — a project-structure tree
  predating the repository restructure, and two links to the retired `TODO.md`
  task tracker — which is out of scope for this phase and is left for the README
  revisions scheduled in the repository-restructure phase (Phase 2) and the
  documentation-closeout phase (Phase 9).
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #18.

**Issues encountered**

- None arose in this phase's own work: adding a single documentation file raised
  no blocker or defect, and there is no application code, test, or build impact.
  The documentation sweep's observation about pre-existing `README.md` staleness,
  noted above under "How it was done", is a deferred out-of-scope item rather
  than an issue in this phase.

**How issues were resolved**

- Not applicable.

## Phase 0 — Repository & Project Setup (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Renamed the working repository on GitHub: `rgoshen-snhu/cs360-WeightToGoMobile`
  → `rgoshen-snhu/WeighToGo`; updated the local `snhu` remote and the `gh`
  default repo.
- Stood up GitHub project tracking: a Project board ("WeighToGo — CS 499
  Capstone"), four epic issues (M2 #2, M3 #3, M4 #4, Final #5), and ten M2 phase
  issues (Phases 0–9, issues #6–#15) attached as sub-issues of the M2 epic.
- Updated old repository-name references in the SRS, README, and CONTRIBUTING;
  fixed a broken CI badge and placeholder repository URLs.
- Added a `## Tasks` section to the issue templates; relocated the Android
  development journal to `docs/history/android_summary.md` and documented the
  new directory with a README.
- Removed two unused legacy GitHub Actions workflows left from an earlier
  integration setup.
- Delivered as PR #16, branch `chore/m2-phase-0-repo-project-setup`.

**How it was done**

- Repository renamed with `gh repo rename`; GitHub's automatic old-URL redirect
  verified (HTTP 301).
- Board, epics, and phase issues created with the `gh` CLI; phase issues linked
  as sub-issues via the GitHub sub-issue API; all issues added to the board.
- Documentation edits were surgical — only repository-name references were
  changed; historical mentions in the SRS naming-considerations narrative were
  deliberately preserved.
- The core change was committed as two atomic commits (`chore:` templates +
  journal relocation, `docs:` repo-name updates), with follow-up commits for
  review findings and owner-directed changes.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #16.

**Issues encountered**

- The `gh` token lacked the `project` OAuth scope, blocking Project board
  creation.
- The journal relocation broke a relative link in `docs/testing/README.md`
  (review finding W1).
- Two unused legacy GitHub Actions workflows were present; the automated review
  workflow failed on every pull request for lack of a configured token secret.
- The newly created `docs/history/` directory was initially undocumented
  (adversarial review note N1).
- Phase 0 expanded beyond the original plan during execution, at the repository
  owner's direction.

**How issues were resolved**

- The owner refreshed the `gh` token with the `project` scope.
- W1 was fixed during the phase — the link was repointed to
  `../history/android_summary.md`.
- The two legacy workflows were removed (owner-directed) after verifying they
  had no branch-protection or file dependencies.
- A README was added for `docs/history/`, resolving N1.
- Broader `docs/` indexing was captured as a separate tracked issue (#17) under
  the M2 epic rather than expanding Phase 0 further.
